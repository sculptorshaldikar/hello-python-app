# Replit Project Documentation

## Overview

This is a minimal Python project containing a single script that outputs "hello" to the console. The project appears to be in its initial stages or serves as a basic template/starting point for Python development.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Core Structure
- **Language**: Python
- **Entry Point**: `main.py` - Contains a simple print statement as the primary executable
- **Architecture Pattern**: Single-file script architecture
- **Execution Model**: Direct script execution

### Design Decisions
- **Simplicity First**: The project follows a minimal approach with no external dependencies or complex structure
- **Direct Execution**: Uses a straightforward script-based approach rather than module or package structure
- **No Framework Dependencies**: Pure Python implementation without additional libraries

## External Dependencies

Currently, this project has no external dependencies:
- No third-party Python packages
- No database connections
- No API integrations
- No external services
- Uses only Python standard library (specifically the built-in `print` function)

The project is completely self-contained and can run with just a Python interpreter.
